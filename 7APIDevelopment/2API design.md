API design is defined as the iterative collection of decisions that lead to a concrete plan for developing, implementing, and maintaining an API.understanding the APIâ€™s end-user, their needs, and how best the API can meet those needs.

Benefits of investing in the design phase include:
-Effective Implementation: A detailed API design can significantly help in the APIs implementation (usually by developers) phase by preventing ambiguity.

-Incremental Development: Having a straightforward design helps know precisely which resource, or sub-resources, would need to be updated (or retired), preventing confusion and leading to less duplicated work.

-Better Documentation: A solid initial API design makes documenting the API faster and less error-prone.

Best practices of three distinct parts of an APIs design:
Collections, Resources, and Their URLs
Requests
Responses

-Collections, Resources, and Their URLs
Use well named URLS
Use the correct HTTP verbs
Requests
Accept query parametrs
-Responses
Provide feedback woth responses
Good feedback involves positive validation on correct implementations and an informative error on incorrect implementations that can help developers debug and correct how they use the API.
