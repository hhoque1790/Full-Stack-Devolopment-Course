The two different approaches to API development: Design First and Code First:

In the “Design-First” approach, the API contract serves as a blueprint for the APIs structure and features and guides the development process.
Good for:
- Better developer experience
- Better communication- Issues can be identified in the design phase before programming
In the “Code-First” approach, since the API is already implemented, it typically serves the role of documentation. 
Good for:
- Small APIs with few endpoints
- Fast delivery but compromising developer experience
