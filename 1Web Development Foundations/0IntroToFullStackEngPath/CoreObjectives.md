### Describe on a broad level how the internet works
__________________________________

>The internet refers to the actual network of connected computing devices enabling devices to share info and resources.

In the client-service model, the client refers to the user’s device or program that is making a request for data. (A client can be a browser or application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet.)

The server is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data.

Clients and servers use the request response cycle to communicate with each other.

### Identify different languages used for web development
__________________________________

The four languages that form the core of the World Wide Web:
1. HTML — structures website content
2. CSS — applies styling to websites
3. JavaScript — adds interactivity to websites
4. SQL — allows your web application to store and retrieve data

Also:
- jQuery was the first JavaScript framework that could fetch data while the web page is running.
- The rise of web frameworks that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.
